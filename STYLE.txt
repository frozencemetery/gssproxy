We adopt a coding style derived from http://freeipa.org/page/Coding_Style

There are minor differences including ut not limited to the following:
- due to the fact we interface to GSSAPI which heavily used typedefs they
  are not actively discouraged in this code base

- Initializations and NULL-checks should use the appropriate GSS_C_NO_XXX
  initializers
