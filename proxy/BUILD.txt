First off, run:
$ autoreconf -f -i

Then the usual $ ./configure # and $ make #

In order to build gss-proxy the following development packages are needed
additionally to a ISO C compiler:

    autoconf
    automake
    docbook-style-xsl
    doxygen
    findutils
    gettext-devel
    libini_config-devel
    keyutils-libs-devel
    krb5-devel
    libselinux-devel
    libtool
    libverto-devel
    libxml2
    libxslt
    m4
    make
    pkgconfig
    popt-devel

For testing via $ make tests # you additionally need these packages:

    krb5-server
    krb5-server-ldap
    krb5-workstation
    nss_wrapper
    openldap-clients
    openldap-servers
    socket_wrapper
    valgrind

NOTE: The minimum supported Kerberos version is MIT Kerberos 1.14 as it
includes [1] for Microsoft interoperability.  gssproxy relies on the
interposer mechanism [1] and so there is no version of gssproxy which will
work before 1.11.  Various other features require newer versions of MIT krb5;
patch out at your own risk.
